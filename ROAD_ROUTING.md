# 🛣️ Road Network Routing - Implementation Guide

## Overview

Your secure notes app now features **real road routing** using the OSRM (Open Source Routing Machine) API! Routes now follow actual roads instead of straight lines.

## ✨ What's New

### Real Road Routes
- Routes follow actual road networks
- Powered by OSRM API with OpenStreetMap data
- Intelligent fallback to straight-line routing if API is unavailable
- Automatic routing with hundreds of waypoints for smooth paths

## 🚀 How to Use

### Setting Up a Route

1. **Open the Map View**
   - Click the "🗺️ Map" button in the toolbar

2. **Set Your Starting Point**
   - Click anywhere on the map to set your start point
   - Or use city preset buttons (Copenhagen, Berlin, London, etc.)
   - A blue marker (📍 START) will appear

3. **Set Your Destination**
   - Click again on the map to set your end point
   - An orange marker (🎯 END) will appear
   - The route automatically calculates!

4. **View Your Route**
   - A blue line will appear showing the actual road path
   - Distance is calculated and displayed
   - Waypoint count shows route detail level

## 🔧 Technical Details

### OSRM API Integration

The app uses the public OSRM routing service:
- **Endpoint**: `http://router.project-osrm.org/route/v1/driving/`
- **Format**: GeoJSON geometry with full overview
- **Timeout**: 10 seconds
- **Fallback**: Straight-line route if unavailable

### Route Calculation Process

1. User clicks start and end points on map
2. App sends coordinates to OSRM API
3. OSRM returns detailed road route as coordinates
4. App renders the route as a smooth line on the map
5. Distance is calculated using Haversine formula

### Code Architecture

**`map.rs` - Router Implementation**
```rust
Router::calculate_route(start, end)
  ├─→ calculate_osrm_route() // Try OSRM first
  │   ├─→ HTTP request to OSRM API
  │   ├─→ Parse GeoJSON response
  │   └─→ Convert to RoutePoint array
  └─→ calculate_straight_route() // Fallback
      └─→ Linear interpolation
```

**`ui.rs` - UI Integration**
- Converts RoutePoint to GeoLocation
- Renders route as connected line segments
- Displays waypoint markers
- Shows distance and waypoint count

## 📊 Performance

### Network Requests
- Only coordinates are sent (no personal data)
- 10-second timeout prevents hanging
- Graceful fallback on failure

### Route Quality
- Typical route: 100-300 waypoints
- Smooth curves following real roads
- Distance accurate to actual driving distance

### Error Handling
- Network failures → straight-line fallback
- Empty routes → straight-line fallback
- Invalid responses → straight-line fallback
- All errors logged to console

## 🌍 Examples

### Short Route (Copenhagen to Malmö)
- ~600 waypoints
- Follows highway E20 across Øresund Bridge
- ~40 km

### Long Route (Copenhagen to Berlin)
- ~1000+ waypoints
- Follows highways through Denmark and Germany
- ~360 km

### International Route (London to Paris)
- Note: Cannot route across English Channel (no road)
- Falls back to straight-line route
- Use for visualization only

## 💡 Tips

1. **Best for road-connected locations**: Works perfectly for cities connected by roads
2. **Oceans and water**: Falls back to straight line (no ferries supported yet)
3. **Zoom in for detail**: See individual road segments at high zoom levels
4. **Offline mode**: If no internet, automatically uses straight-line routing
5. **International routes**: Works across countries within same continent

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

**Route looks strange or goes through water**
- Check internet connection
- OSRM may not have ferry routes
- Look for console message about fallback

**Route is a straight line**
- This means OSRM API was unavailable
- App fell back to straight-line routing
- Check console for error message

**Route calculation is slow**
- First request may take a few seconds
- Long-distance routes have more waypoints
- 10-second timeout will trigger fallback

## 🚧 Limitations

### Current Limitations
- Only driving routes (no walking, cycling options yet)
- No ferry routes
- No traffic considerations
- No turn-by-turn directions

### Planned Enhancements
- Multiple routing profiles (car, bike, pedestrian)
- Offline routing using local OSM data
- Turn-by-turn navigation instructions
- Estimated travel time
- Alternative routes

## 📝 API Usage

This app uses the public OSRM demo server. For production use or high volume:
- Consider hosting your own OSRM instance
- See: https://github.com/Project-OSRM/osrm-backend
- Respect usage limits of public servers

**Happy routing!** 🗺️🚗✨
